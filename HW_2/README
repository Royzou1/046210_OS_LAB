
can we change mpi_api? do we need to?
what to do in case of 2 errors? which comes firs?

schedule: 
    when calling the sys_mpi_poll if theres no msgs then it goes to sleep until 
    condition or timeout. this should be (and is) atomic since it being done by the OS.
    
HOW?
    change in task_struct -> status to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE?
    how to do timeout?

    whenever a proc sends a msg to the waiting proc it wakes up the sleeping proc 
    if it is already waken, nothing happens which is fine.
